IMPORTANT NOTES {
    CRLF: cannot split file on double \n for some reason... Or even double "\r\n\r\n" // 20200807
    declarations: no errors are given if a constant is used before it is declared! So need separate declaration of global variables section at start...
    destructuring declarations: 
    dialogs: using sync dialogs is easier!
    require("fs"); If replaced by ES6-module, does not work anymore for some reason...
    sorting:  const caseIndependentSort = (a, b) => a.toLowerCase().localeCompare(b.toLowerCase()) does not work well when combine with find... Neither does return aLower.compare(bLower);

    TERMS:
      UI-elements
      DATA structures

      UI-elements 

      DATA structures 
        entries: current entries 
        sourcefilenames: the names of all source files. The currently used one is the first one.
