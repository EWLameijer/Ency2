  !! ALWAYS CREATE NEW BRANCH FOR FEATURE 

  2. rename entry: 20/40 min 
  3. bestudeer editen: bv save not tab-targeted? 2 v 15 m 
  4. possibly refactor to have all function assignments in JS instead of HTML (to make ESlint less troublesome?) 10m vs 20m
  5. Make a nicer readme.md; 
}

IMPORTANT NOTES {
    CRLF: cannot split file on double \n for some reason... Or even double "\r\n\r\n" // 20200807
    declarations: no errors are given if a constant is used before it is declared! So need separate declaration of global variables section at start...
    destructuring declarations: 
    dialogs: using sync dialogs is easier!
    require("fs"); If replaced by ES6-module, does not work anymore for some reason...
    sorting:  const caseIndependentSort = (a, b) => a.toLowerCase().localeCompare(b.toLowerCase()) does not work well when combine with find... Neither does return aLower.compare(bLower);

DONE {
    1. create a label (or such where the full term is displayed) // DONE 20200805-16:05
    2. Put the contents of the description in a textbox/textarea // DONE 20200806-08:31
    2.1: create map to hold all the values.// DONE 20200806-11:44
    2.2. let the fields be initialized from the entries! 11:45  // DONE 20200806-11:57
    2.3. See if you can let the desciption be updated... // DONE  20200807-07:19
    2.4. Always sort the terms in the beginning, so aardbei is before appel...  // DONE  20200807-07:19
     2.5. Allow adding terms (after enter in ). Or basically whenever text is entered // DONE 20200807-7:30
    3. investigate how to save the modified data (max 5x15 try/internet, 5x15 read book) // DONE  20200807-07:19
      GOAL (session1, 20200807-07:47): ai should load AI  DONE 20200807-0749
    GOAL2 (session1, 20200807-07:47): on term selection, only later terms should be shown below DONE 20200807-0753
    GOAL3 (session1, 20200807-07:47): find out why critic is independent -> because it has ':'. Change requirement to 'start with tab? or not has ':'?
    GOAL3 (session1, 20200807-07:47): need bigger window + textarea DONE 20200807-0805
    GOAL4 (session2): find out how to get newlines in text area. Enter "\n"? Or give it as list of lines? DONE 20200807-0814
    URGENT: Why doesn't A* search work? => was upper/lowercasesearch.
       GOAL: 1) Check whether AI is now correct. If it seems to be, test updating it. => seems okay.
  2) 15-line limit for functions // OK 
  3) create backup of original => IS GOAL! so like "backup.txt"
  4) when writing, overwrite original // done!
  2. prune enters at the end of items // done!
  1. start with first entry DONE!
  2. En escape om term te clearen? Of uberhaput om naar term terug te gaan en die te clearen?!
  2. what if wantin to add constraint as term when there already is a constraingt satisfaction problem 500 20 [so when tab-as now to description, when enter: make new description]
   => was actually 13 minutes, not 20.
   2. ? allow home button (for @:, for example?) 100v 5 m  DONE
    3. make button for removing bad entries ("game gt") 25/6
    Phase 2: show name (base name) of source file in top of ency 
      // Phase 2: remove possible extension (.txt) from name shown on top of file...20200809
      okay. Phase 1: check the correctness of initializeEntries() for one last time. Then remove the alerts, and commit it. // case 1, 2, 3, 4 5 works.
  // IMPORTANT! <new file> does not seem to work properly when adding entries
  // Phase 3: when saving, automatically save the filename in the defaultency. If no filename is known, show a save file dialog 
    => this may be tricky. Try 15 min, then read 15 min electron. Then 15 min other task. Then 15-15-30, 15-15-60, 15-15-120 etc.
  // 

  1. automatically generate default_ency.txt if it does not exist yet, or at least don't crash if it is lacking. 100/10 m
  1. Allow loading fresh files (and save them in the defaultency); . 50v/20m // DONE 20200810
