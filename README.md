If you ever make notes, especially if you are making many notes on something (like when learning a programming language, or studying a scientific field), you may have noticed that having a large Word document is not necessarily ideal. You can add an entry, but retrieving the information you need can be rather laborious, especially since synonyms and superficial mentions ('uniform cost search' -> 'can be used by uniform cost search') either result in you not retrieving what you are looking for, or finding too many mentions, and having to click through a row of 'find next's.
